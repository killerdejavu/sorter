# 🎭 Tab-zilla: The Tab Tamer
### Because your browser shouldn't look like a digital episode of "Hoarders" 📺

Are you drowning in a sea of tabs? Does your Chrome look like it's trying to break the world record for "Most Simultaneously Open Web Pages While Still Functioning... Barely"? 

Fear not, fellow tab hoarder! **Tab-zilla** is here to rescue you from the chaos! 

## 🦸‍♂️ What This Extension Actually Does

- **Sorts your tabs** faster than a caffeinated librarian
- **Groups them** like a gym teacher picking dodgeball teams (but fairly)
- **Organizes by domain** because tabs from the same family should stick together

## 🎮 How to Use It (Even a Sleep-Deprived Developer Can Do It!)

1. Click the extension icon (it's the one that doesn't spark joy... yet)
2. Choose your sorting destiny:
   - **Sort tabs**: Alphabetically arranges tabs like books in a library (if libraries were run by very obsessive-compulsive librarians)
   - **Group tabs**: Creates tab groups faster than you can say "Why did I open all these tabs anyway?"

## 🎯 Perfect For:
- Tab addicts (the first step is admitting you have a problem)
- People whose browser looks like it's playing Tetris with webpages
- Anyone who's ever said "I'll read it later" and actually meant it
- Digital pack rats who can't bear to close a single tab

## 💡 Pro Tips:
1. Use it before your computer starts begging for mercy
2. Perfect for those "I swear I had that tab open somewhere" moments
3. Impress your colleagues with your suddenly organized browser
   (They don't need to know it was all thanks to an extension)

## 🤓 Technical Stuff (for the nerds among us):
- Written in JavaScript (because apparently that's what the cool kids use)
- Uses Chrome Extension API (because we like to live dangerously)
- Works like magic (but actually it's just clever coding)

## 🎉 Installation:
1. Install the extension
2. Watch in amazement as your digital life gets tidier
3. Tell all your friends about it (or don't, and look like a tab-organizing genius)

## Disclaimer:
This extension may cause:
- Sudden bursts of productivity
- A strange feeling of digital organization
- Withdrawal symptoms from tab chaos
- The urge to sort everything in your life

Remember: With great tab organization comes great responsibility.
